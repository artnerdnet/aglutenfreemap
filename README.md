# Gluten Free Map

### Description

This map has been created for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree, as a final project. It has been developed on `React` with `create-react-app`, fetching data from `Google Maps API` and `FourSquare API`.

### Project Instructions

The goal was to build single-page application using React featuring a map of an area you live in or woud like to visit. Adding additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. It was required to implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations.

### Run the Application
npm start 

- Clone or download this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/artnerdnet/bcnglutenfree.git
    ```

- Once you are inside the folder, run `npm install`
- Run the development server with `npm start`

## Service Worker

```
npm run build
```
